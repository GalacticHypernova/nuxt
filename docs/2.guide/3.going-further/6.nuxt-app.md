# NuxtApp

In Nuxt 3, you can access runtime app context within composables, components and plugins. In Nuxt 2, this was referred to as [Nuxt context](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/internals-glossary/context#the-context).

## The Nuxt context

Many composables and utilities, both built-in and user-made, may require access to the Nuxt instance. You may get an error stating that "A composable that requires access to the Nuxt instance was called outside of a plugin, Nuxt hook, Nuxt middleware, or Vue setup function." when trying to use a certain composable (for example, [useState](/docs/api/composables/use-state)). That is because that specific composable needs to access the Nuxt context, which doesn't exist everywhere on your application. Currently, the Nuxt context is only accessible in [plugins](/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins), [Nuxt hooks](/docs/guide/going-further/hooks), [Nuxt middleware](/docs/guide/directory-structure/middleware), and [setup functions](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-setup.html) (in pages and components).

## Accessing NuxtApp

Within composables, plugins and components you can access `nuxtApp` with `useNuxtApp`:

```js
function useMyComposable () {
  const nuxtApp = useNuxtApp()
  // access runtime nuxt app instance
}
```

Plugins also receive `nuxtApp` as the first argument for convenience. [Read more about plugins.](/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins)

**`useNuxtApp` (on the server) only works during `setup`, inside Nuxt plugins or `Lifecycle Hooks`**.

## Providing Helpers

You can provide helpers to be usable across all composables and application. This usually happens within a Nuxt plugin.

```js
const nuxtApp = useNuxtApp()
nuxtApp.provide('hello', (name) => `Hello ${name}!`)

console.log(nuxtApp.$hello('name')) // Prints "Hello name!"
```

In Nuxt 2 plugins, this was referred to as [inject function](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/plugins#inject-in-root--context).

::alert{icon=ðŸ‘‰}
It is possible to inject helpers by returning an object with a `provide` key. See the [plugins documentation](/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins) for more information.
