## Minimal Usage

During the development of your application, some errors may appear unexpectedly at runtime. For such case, we can use the `error.vue` file to display it nicely.

```vue [error.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps({
  error: Object
})
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ error.statusCode }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```
