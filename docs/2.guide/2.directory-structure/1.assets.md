# Assets Directory

The `assets/` directory is for all the website's assets, which the build tool (webpack or Vite) will process.

The directory usually contains the following types of files:

- Stylesheets (CSS, SASS, etc.)
- Fonts
- Images that won't get served from the [`public/`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/public) directory.

If you want to serve assets from the server, we recommend to look at the [`public/`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/public) directory.
