# `useRequestEvent`

Within the [Nuxt context](/docs/guide/going-further/nuxt-app#the-nuxt-context) you can use `useRequestEvent` to access the incoming request.

```js
// Get underlying request event
const event = useRequestEvent()

// Get the URL
const url = event.path
```

::alert{icon=ðŸ‘‰}
In the browser, `useRequestEvent` will return `undefined`.
